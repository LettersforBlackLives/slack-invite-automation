## Reporting

<div class="onboarding__step-content">

If you are being harassed by a member of Letter for Black Lives, or have any other concerns, immediately contact an admin or organizer. (*You can contact the admins with the `/admin [your message]` command in Slack.*)

In order to protect volunteer organizers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Letters for Black Lives members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Letters for Black Lives spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Letters for Black Lives members or the general public.
