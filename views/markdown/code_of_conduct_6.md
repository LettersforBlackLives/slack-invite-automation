Letters for Black Lives started as a collaborative community that grew from a shared sense of responsibility. We are committed to that responsibility and will look out for and support each other in our shared goals.

We wanted to write a letter ‚Äî not a think piece or an explainer or a history lesson ‚Äî because changing hearts and minds in our community requires time and trust, and is best shaped with dialogue. We also want to do our part to normalize support for Black Lives Matter.

This project was always intended to be as decentralized and open to public input and contribution as possible, while maintaining momentum towards the goal. Many hands wrote the letter, and many more are translating it and working on outreach. Everything is loosely organized around the twin principles of maximum transparency / DIY ‚Äî if you have an additive idea, you should run with it or create space/resources for other people who will. If you want to change or reorganize something, start a discussion in a comment thread to give people the chance to weigh in.

We ‚ù§ spinoffs, remixes, respectful conversation between our peers. We üíî infighting, internet asshole behavior, centering ourselves in a conversation that is about anti-Blackness. Our hope is to make it easier for people to start difficult conversations, build empathy and understanding, and move us forward to real change.
