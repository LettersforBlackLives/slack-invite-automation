## Join the Letters for Black Lives Community

<div class="onboarding__step-content">

Hello! We’re thrilled that you’d like to join the community of 400+ organizers, translators, writers, technologists, and more who make up the effort.

Our ability to work effectively with each other is based on having a clear understanding of how this project fits within the broader context as well as having clear expectations on how we interact with each other.

As such, please read through the **About LFBL** and **Code of Conduct** sections below. If you agree with this framing, we welcome you to join via the link below.

ps. Press and researchers are welcome to join, however please note that everything is off the record except for the #on-the-record channel.
