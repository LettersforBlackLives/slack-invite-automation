## The Short Version

<div class="onboarding__step-content">

* We are committed to taking care of each other.
* We are committed to being collaborative.
* Listen and learn. Respect people’s identities and life experiences, they will be different from yours.
* No harassment. We *will* take appropriate action against harassers.
* Sometimes we do not live up to our best, even when acting in good faith. If you do, apologize, learn, and move on.
* Understand that when you hurt someone and apologize, they have no obligation to forgive you. It is up to you to change, not them.
* This Code of Conduct applies to all Letters for Black Lives spaces (including our working Google Docs, [Slack Team](http://slack-invite.lettersforblacklives.com/), and in-person events).
