## About Letters for Black Lives

<div class="onboarding__step-content">

Letters for Black Lives is a set of crowdsourced, multilingual, and culturally-aware resources aimed at creating a space for open and honest conversations about racial justice, police violence, and anti-Blackness in our families and communities.

We began as a group of Asian Americans and Canadians writing an intergenerational letter to voice our concerns and support for the Black community. We have since grown to include other immigrant groups and communities of color. Our goal is to listen, support, and amplify the message of Black Lives Matter within our communities.

We encourage people from all communities to adapt and build off of these resources.

## Community Code of Conduct for Letters for Black Lives

This code of conduct governs the Letters for Black Lives (LFBL) community. We create it not because we expect bad behavior, but because laying out our values and obligations to each other reinforces our bonds of solidarity and having a code provides a guidestar for when we stumble.
