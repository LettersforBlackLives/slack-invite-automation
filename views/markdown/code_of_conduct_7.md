## Expected Behaviors

<div class="onboarding__step-content">

Letters for Black Lives is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. Every member of the community is expected to be considerate of and respectful towards others.

The injustices we are all here to try to right are complex and multi-faceted, no single person will have perfect knowledge, that is why we must all come from a place of openness so we can all succeed in our goals.

**Be supportive**. We are here because we share the goal of improving racial discourse and racial justice in our families and communities. We will often have similar experiences, but not everyone’s story will be shared. Above all else, try to listen and understand before questioning and judging.

**Be collaborative**. Letters for Black Lives started as a collaborative, public, Google Doc. We strive to involve anyone and everyone who is making an honest effort to contribute. The strength of our work is in each other, do not be afraid to ask for help or feedback. Don’t succumb to imposter syndrome (your particular experiences and knowledge are unique to you, and are welcome), or [blowhard syndrome](http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/post/110549967516/stop-blowhard-syndrome).

**Be engaged**. You do not need to have a deep understanding of intersectional justice or the history of Eurocentric supremacy, but you do need to appreciate that justice for all communities of color are intertwined, and much of the progress we’ve had so far is fundamentally because of Black activists.

**Be generous, kind, and humane**. Be polite and friendly. Communicating is hard, especially online where we lack many nonverbal cues. If you may have misunderstood something, gently ask for a clarification. Respect others when they do the same.

**Meet people where they are**. Not everybody knows as much as you do in your domain of expertise and we all have much to learn from one another. (Willful ignorance, however, is violence and will not be tolerated.)

**Respect people’s privacy and will to self-determination**. If someone wishes to be left alone, please respect that. We all make mistakes, if you have wronged someone, take care to make amends, but do not always expect it to be accepted. Acceptance and forgiveness can only be given freely, they can not be taken.

**Take time to care for yourself, respect when others do, too**. Social justice is hard, tiring work. And this is a marathon, not a sprint. Know when you need to step away and let others share the load for a while, and look out for each other, in case they do, too.
